To submit or modify a shape, please create a pull request to the main branch that satisfies the following requirements:
 - The shape must be in the `shapes` directory.
 - The shape must be written in [SHACL Compact Syntax](https://w3c.github.io/shacl/shacl-compact-syntax/) or [Extended SHACL Compact Syntax](https://github.com/jeswr/shaclcjs/).

For now we don't have many guard rails in place, but we will be adding more as we go. If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue!
