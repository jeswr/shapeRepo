<img src="./images/logo.svg" width="40px"> Solid Shape Repo

This is a repository for storing and sharing solid shapes. This is designed to be a collaborative project similar to [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/).

Existing shapes are found [here](https://github.com/jeswr/shapeRepo/tree/main/shapes) and served and served at [https://www.shapes.jeswr.org/](https://www.shapes.jeswr.org/) with content negotiation.

Currently shapes are only served in their current shape by name. For instance the example shape should be found at https://www.shapes.jeswr.org/example. We aim to also add versioning support in the near future to allow one to retrieve different versions of each shape.

New shapes can be contributed via a pull request. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
